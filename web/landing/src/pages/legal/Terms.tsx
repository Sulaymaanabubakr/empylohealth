                        <h2>7. Information received through the Platform</h2>
                        <p><strong>7.1</strong> All Circles Health App requires all users to complete a short induction within the app to ensure they understand how the app works and their responsibility to seek professional and medical support for chronic and acute mental health conditions. Additionally, all users must agree to act with good intentions whilst using the app and must report any abusive behaviour or suspicious activity immediately to ensure we investigate and respond promptly.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.2</strong> Circles Health App is not itself a health care provider or a provider of medical services; we are a tech company that creates mental health and emotional wellbeing content and tools and that facilitates interactions between users and other users. We provide a simple interface to allow users to measure and input their mental wellbeing scores, and we continuously supervise and monitor our app to ensure legitimate use. However, we have two very important limitations to bring to your attention:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) Circles Health App IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTERVENTIONS RECEIVED BY USERS THROUGH THE PLATFORM AND FROM OTHER USERS. Despite the care we take described in 7.1, some of the content on the Platform generally, or given to users by other users, may be incorrect, mistimed or inappropriate, generally or for a particular user.</li>
                            <li>(b) Circles Health App IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION THAT USERS TAKE OR DO NOT TAKE AS A RESULT OF INFORMATION GIVEN THROUGH THE PLATFORM. What users choose to do with the information given through the Platform is their choice. In other words, your reliance on any information is at your own risk. We are not a medical service. General information on the Platform may not be appropriate for individual and group users. In addition, tailored information, given in good faith by a user to a user, may not be appropriate for individual users. If in doubt, users should contact their own registered medical professionals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>7.3</strong> If the Platform is not available at any time, either due to a planned or unplanned outage of the Platform, PLEASE DO NOT DELAY SEEKING MEDICAL HELP if you think you may need it. We are not responsible for not providing our service in a timely manner, whatever the reason for us not being able to provide a timely service. We do not promise that the Platform will be available continuously. We are not obligated to make available the Platform services to you if you are in violation of Circles Health App Platform T&Cs.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.4</strong> You are advised to exercise a high level of care and caution in the use of the Platform. You understand and agree that you are aware that the services offered through the Platform may not be a substitute for general mental health care. You should never rely on or make health or well-being decisions purely on use of the Platform. Never avoid or delay obtaining medical advice from your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider, or by traditional face-to-face appointment, as a result of information or information you received through the Platform.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.5</strong> You accept and agree that Circles Health App provides an electronic Platform which acts simply as an introducing mechanism allowing users to interact directly with your chosen connections including friends, family, colleagues and special community groups. Users are independent of Circles Health App and are independent third party contractors or consultants. Circles Health App itself is not a party to any services provided by other users or any legal relationship created between you and other users as a result of your use of the Circles Health App Platform.</p>
                        <p className="alert-box"><strong>7.6</strong> DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL NEEDS. IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES IMMEDIATELY.</p>

                        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                        <p><strong>8.1</strong> There are certain responsibilities that, by law, we aren’t allowed to exclude, including our legal responsibility for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, and we acknowledge those responsibilities.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.2</strong> However, apart from the legal responsibilities mentioned in 8.1, we shall not be legally liable to users for any loss (both immediate and indirect) or damage suffered by a user. We shall not be liable for any special, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind. This is a general exclusion, which includes the exclusions set out in 8.1.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.3</strong> All legal obligations which may be implied or incorporated into the Terms by law or regulation are expressly excluded to the extent permitted by law. We have tried to make these Terms sufficiently comprehensive and clear and we don’t wish any other terms to be implied.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.4</strong> In the event that any limitation or exclusion of liability in the Terms is not enforceable, then we shall not be liable to you for more than 100% of the fees you’ve paid us in the twelve months preceding the day you make your complaint.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.5</strong> The limitations of liability contained within clause 8.4 do not apply to any liability that arises as a result of Circles Health App's failure to comply with the Data Protection Act 2018 and as amended and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or any other applicable similar laws relating to the protection of personal data that apply to the Platform. Subject to clause 8.1 and 8.2, Circles Health App's maximum aggregate liability under this clause 8.5 shall be £1,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, Circles Health App shall not be liable for any special, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind.</p>

                        <p><strong>9.1</strong> Our Platform may include links to other websites owned and operated by third parties. We have no responsibility for the content of such third party websites.</p>
                        <p><strong>9.2</strong> We have no control over third party websites and their contents, and we accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.</p>

                        <h2>10. General Terms</h2>
                        <p><strong>10.1</strong> If any of the Terms are held to be illegal or unenforceable, those (but only those) provisions shall be deemed to be deleted and the rest of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.2</strong> The Terms constitute the entire agreement and replace any previous agreement or understanding (in whatever form) between us in respect of the matters contained or referred to in the Terms. You agree that you have not relied on and have no legal remedy in respect of, any statements (however communicated) which are not replicated or are inconsistent with the Terms.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.3</strong> We have the right at all times to edit, refuse to post, or to remove from the Circles Health App Platform any Content.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.4</strong> You may not assign, transfer or subcontract any of your rights under the Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sub-contract all or any of our rights at any time without consent.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.5</strong> A person who is not a party to the Terms shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any provision in the Terms.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.6</strong> No waiver by either of us shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver shall constitute a continuing waiver so as to prevent us or you from acting upon any continuing or subsequent breach or default.</p>
                        <p><strong>10.7</strong> The Terms shall be subject to the laws of England and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>
